            <p class="mb-2">Hope Hawkins, RYT500, E-RYT200, YACEP, and MA holder, lives on her family farm with her husband, two toddlers, and many animals. Her journey into yoga began as a way to soothe anxiety and find direction in life. Through yoga, she discovered her true passion: helping others (and herself) grow in strength, stability, and clarity.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">With over a decade of experience, Hope brings a deep passion for holistic wellness and a commitment to making yoga accessible to everyone. Her teaching style emphasizes inclusivity and personal growth, ensuring all students feel welcome and supported.</p>
            <p class="mb-2">Hope focuses on community building within rural areas and bringing yoga to diverse populations. Introduced to Ashtanga in 2021, she practices this form personally and is excited to show that Ashtanga is an accessible and sustainable yoga practice.</p>
