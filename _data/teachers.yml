    Cheri Mahoney is a cowgirl from Kansas who moved to Kentucky in 2023 after
    spending time out West. With a background in military service and
    engineering within the metal manufacturing industry, her path naturally led

    Cheri’s teaching style is gentle and nurturing, creating a welcoming
    environment for all ages and abilities. She brings a grounded, compassionate
    presence to each session, helping others reconnect with their bodies through

    road bike or answering the call of the wild on a new adventure.
