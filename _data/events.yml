    Get ready to pump you and your face up!

    Whether you’d like to freeze frame your face, turn back the hands of time,
    lift and tone, or just

    want to learn how to give yourself a spa like pampering at home… this
    workshop will teach you

    that and so much more! It’s also the perfect, late Galentine’s date outing ♥

    This is a crash course into Andrea’s skincare routine, supplements and
    products, facial

    massages and exercises, lymphatic drainage, and face tool usage.

    After class you will receive a detailed PDF containing all information
