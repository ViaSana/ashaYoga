    Experience deep rest and energetic alignment through a guided restorative
    yoga practice paired with a crystal singing bowl sound journey, led by
    Elderwood in collaboration with Asha Yoga. This class is designed as a
    gentle journey through the chakra system, using sound, stillness, and
    supportive postures to encourage relaxation, balance, and renewal.
    Participants will be fully supported with props while sound vibrations help
    calm the nervous system and promote a meditative state. This experience is
    accessible to all levels and especially supportive for stress relief,
    emotional release, and deep rest. We will be laying on the ground so the
    ability to move to and from the floor is highly recommended.

    A collaboration with The Flower Cave at Asha Yoga

    Welcome the first day of spring with beauty, intention, and community.

    Join us for a magical afternoon as we celebrate renewal and fresh
    beginnings. In collaboration with The Flower Cave, you’ll create your own
    fresh flower crown — a wearable reminder of your creativity and the
    blossoming season ahead.

    After crafting, we’ll move through a gentle, heart-opening yoga practice
    designed to awaken the body, clear stagnant winter energy, and ground you in
    your intentions for spring. This practice is accessible to all levels and
    focused on mindful movement and breath.

    We’ll close our time together with a powerful manifestation ritual using
    flying wish paper — writing down what you’re ready to call in and releasing
    it to the universe in a beautiful, symbolic way.

    Come as you are. Leave crowned, centered, and inspired.

    Spots are limited. Reserve yours early to welcome spring in full bloom.
