    way to get a feel for the styles we offer and discover what resonates with
    your body.

    After the movement portion, stay for refreshments and community time. Meet
    other students, chat with teachers, and enjoy a warm, welcoming environment.

    This event is open to everyone — brand new beginners, seasoned
    practitioners, or anyone curious about what we offer.
