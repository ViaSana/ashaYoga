    Lanterns will glow. Candles will flicker. The circle opens for twenty-five
    souls as we step into the hush of Samhain — the ancient threshold between
    harvest and winter, memory and mystery.


    Guided by crystal singing bowls, tuning forks, and bardic storytelling, this
    immersive sound journey becomes a sanctuary of sound and stillness at the
    year’s turning.
