  heading: 'Manifesting Your Year: Root to Crown'

    Step into the new year with clarity, intention, and a grounded sense of
    purpose. Manifesting Your Year: Root to Crown is more than a workshop—it’s a
    guided afternoon designed to help you slow down, tune in, and give shape to
    what you truly want 2026 to hold.

    We’ll move gently to settle the body, then shift into meaningful inner work:

    ✨ Personal intention setting to align with what matters most

    ✨ Creative practices like vision boards and intention bottles to anchor your
    goals into something tangible

    ✨ Mindful reflection to help you understand not just what you want—but why
    you want it

    This workshop is built on quiet intention rather than loud resolutions. No
    pressure, no performative “new year, new me”—just space to breathe, reflect,
    and plant the seeds of a year that feels authentic to you.
