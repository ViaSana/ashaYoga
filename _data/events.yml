    Come hike with us!

    Enjoy a  morning of nature, mindful movement, and tasty local snacks. We’ll
    explore the trails, taking in our surroundings and using our observational
    skills as a mindfulness practice. Jeanna from Mammoth Valley will treat us
    to snacks from her local goods store. We will meet at Mammoth Valley to
    carpool.


    🌿 What to bring:


    Yourself


    A Friend


    Water


    A snack to share (optional)


    🚶‍♀️ Please note: You’ll need to be able to hike over uneven terrain. The
    Cedar Sink Trail is a 2-mile down and back trail.


    💵 Cost: $15 per person (cash or Venmo @hopebrianne)

    A portion of proceeds will benefit the Trini Foundation — and you're welcome
    to donate more if you’d like!


    We’d love to have you join us!
