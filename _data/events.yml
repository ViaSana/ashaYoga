    Join us for an immersive afternoon designed to educate, align, and nourish
    your energy from root to crown. This special workshop blends ancient wisdom
    with modern understanding as Hope Hawkins, MA, E-RYT500, YACEP guides an
    exploration into the history and science of the chakra system and energetic
    body, making these concepts accessible, grounded, and practical for everyday
    life.

    Cherilyn Mahoney, RYT200 will then move you gently through breathwork and a
    seated flow to awaken and balance each energy center, followed by a guided
    meditation with sound bowls to integrate the experience.


    To close our time together, we will provide journals to help you reflect,
    set intentions, and deepen your personal connection to the work while you
    enjoy a build-your-own yogurt bar. This time is an offering to ground,
    connect, and nourish your physical body after our energetic journey.

    Each participant will receive a take-home journal to continue your practice
    and exploration beyond the workshop.

    This workshop is open to all levels—no prior knowledge of chakras or energy
    work is needed. Come curious, leave aligned, informed, and supported.

    Ayurveda, often called the wisdom of life, offers a compassionate framework
    for understanding yourself and creating balance from the inside out. In this
    interactive workshop, we’ll explore the basics of Ayurvedic philosophy and
    how it shows up in daily life—without overwhelm or jargon.


    Together we’ll dive into:


    The three doshas and how they influence body and mind


    The six tastes and why they matter


    Key Ayurvedic qualities (gunas) explained through real-life examples


    The experience is designed to be conversational, supportive, and adaptable
    to the group, with time for questions, reflection, and rest. Whether you’re
    brand new to Ayurveda or looking to deepen your understanding, this workshop
    will give you simple tools to bring more balance and ease into your everyday
    routines.
