    Ayurveda, often called the wisdom of life, offers a compassionate framework
    for understanding yourself and creating balance from the inside out. In this
    interactive workshop, we’ll explore the basics of Ayurvedic philosophy and
    how it shows up in daily life—without overwhelm or jargon.


    Together we’ll dive into:


    The three doshas and how they influence body and mind


    The six tastes and why they matter


    Key Ayurvedic qualities (gunas) explained through real-life examples


    The experience is designed to be conversational, supportive, and adaptable
    to the group, with time for questions, reflection, and rest. Whether you’re
    brand new to Ayurveda or looking to deepen your understanding, this workshop
    will give you simple tools to bring more balance and ease into your everyday
    routines.

    Experience deep rest and energetic alignment through a guided restorative
    yoga practice paired with a crystal singing bowl sound journey, led by
    Elderwood in collaboration with Asha Yoga. This class is designed as a
    gentle journey through the chakra system, using sound, stillness, and
    supportive postures to encourage relaxation, balance, and renewal.
    Participants will be fully supported with props while sound vibrations help
    calm the nervous system and promote a meditative state. This experience is
    accessible to all levels and especially supportive for stress relief,
    emotional release, and deep rest. We will be laying on the ground so the
    ability to move to and from the floor is highly recommended.
