    Root to Crown: Restore and Renew Under the New Moon


    Join Michael Harper (Elderwood) and Hope Hawkins (Asha Yoga) for a deeply
    grounding evening of restorative yoga and sound.

    Together we’ll move through gentle, supported postures designed to relax the
    body and open the energetic pathways of the chakras — from root to crown.


    As you rest, experience a guided sound journey featuring crystal bowls that
    promotes alignment, clarity, and renewal. The energy of the new moon invites
    fresh beginnings and manifestation — a perfect time to release, reset, and
    reconnect within community.

    No experience needed. All props provided.

    Come as you are and leave feeling balanced, restored, and renewed.

    This class is perfect for tea lovers and beginners alike—whether you’re
    looking to create calming blends for relaxation, energizing teas for focus,
    or nourishing mixes for everyday wellness. You’ll leave with your own custom
    blends to enjoy at home, plus the knowledge to continue crafting teas that
    suit your mood and needs.
