    WE WILL MEET AT BEAVER TRAIL PARK FOR THIS EVENT.  Join Eleni for a
    45-minute Stroller Fit class designed for parents and caregivers! We’ll
    combine brisk walking with bodyweight exercises—all while your little one
    enjoys the ride in their stroller. It’s a great way to get moving, connect
    with others, and enjoy the outdoors. All fitness levels welcome. Don’t
    forget your stroller, water, and a smile!
