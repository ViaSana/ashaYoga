    Earrings that stand out without swinging about! ™️

    Handmade ear climbers crafted with love in KY💙

    Originally from Trenton, Kentucky I moved to Bowling Green, KY in 2002 to
    attend and later graduate from WKU. In 2006 I met my partner Nick and we’ve
    been together ever since. Our only other family member is our 14 year old
    cat, Spade. I consider myself to be a strong, authentic, and confident being
    that lives life from my heart. I’m a hard worker and loyal friend. Physical
    fitness and spiritual growth has always been a big part of my life. I enjoy
    working out regularly and maintaining a daily spiritual practice.

    How It Started: On a family vacation in 2009 I came across a funny looking
    pair of earrings which I quickly learned were called “ear
    climbers/crawlers.” Immediately they became my favorite pair of earrings!
    They even had some sentimental value having purchased them during the last
    family vacation we would attend with Nick’s grandfather. In 2016, while
    staying at a hotel, I lost one down a shower drain. Devastated, I remember
    looking at Nick and saying, “Well, I guess I’ll be learning how to make
    these.” With no jewelry making skills, I completely taught myself how to
    recreate them based solely on the remaining climber. At first I made them
    for myself as well as gifts for family and friends. In 2017 I could see I
    was onto something and Runaway Love was born. 

    Origin of the Name: Runaway was the name of my tabby cat that passed away
    the year the company was created. She was extremely special to me. Naming
    the company after her just made sense, and allowed me to honor her forever.

    Hello my name is Meranda Caswell. I am a multidiscipline, mixed media,
    treasure hunter, and soul searching artist.

    I share my vision with the world in the hope of inspiring one to live and
    love deeply. To be fearless, adventurous, and spread ones light on this
    earth. My love is preserving time, memories, and treasures. I  attended New
    Orleans Academy Of Fine Arts in New Orleans for photography, drawing, and
    painting. New Orleans swooned me with it's incredible beauty and magic. It
    was that deep connection that sent me on my journey as an artist.

    Rustic Revival has evolved from the natural views in this country. Key West
    to Alaska. Traveling North America is a dream. Sandy beaches, towering
    Denali, massive Sequoias, Grand Canyons, endless deserts, small creeks,
    raging rivers, waterfalls and all the wildlife in between. Nature has a way
    of shaping a person. I'm doing my best to experience it all. From small
    overnight trips to living out of my car for a year. My resume consists of a
    truck driving garbage man, certified machinist, years in restaurants,
    commercial Helicopter Pilots license, and building and construction. None of
    which seem to influence as much as a walk in the woods. I keep that in mind
    when we are in the shop. Not so much keep it simple as, Keep it Natural. I
    am mostly self taught and learning from the mistakes. Rustic Revival uses
    resin to stabilized beautiful lumber and still able to apply traditional
    woodworking technics to create art.
