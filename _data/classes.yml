    Mysore-style Ashtanga yoga is a self-led class, allowing for individual
    instruction and pacing while following a specific set of movements. Your
    teacher will guide and assist you individually within a group setting.  In
    the beginning, new students receive more attention. You may arrive at any
    time before 8am to ensure you have finished your practice by 9am. All Levels
    Welcome---Beginners to seasoned yogis! Mysore is more readily practiced with
    the mobility to move from floor to standing.

    Our Flow classes are designed to meet you exactly where you are. Whether
    you're stepping onto the mat for the first time or deepening an ongoing
    practice, you'll find an energizing and supportive space here. Each class
    blends mindful movement, breath, and strength-building sequences to help you
    reconnect with your body and spirit.

    We believe yoga is a personal journey — not about perfect poses, but about
    showing up for yourself with dedication and curiosity. Come as you are, move
    at your own pace, and leave feeling empowered, refreshed, and more at home
    within yourself.

    All bodies, all backgrounds, all experiences welcome. (If you have mobility
    issues, please discuss with staff and we will likely be able to accommodate
    you!)

    Join us for a rejuvenating yoga session designed to ease you into your week
    with intention and calm. We begin with mindful, flowing movements and breath
    work to awaken the body and center the mind. Then, we move into foundational
    postures supported by bolsters, blocks, and blankets—holding each pose for
    3–5 minutes to deepen relaxation and release tension. We finish with a
    peaceful meditation and an extended savasana to leave you grounded and
    refreshed.

    All levels are welcome. Participants should be comfortable moving to and
    from the floor.
