  summary_description: >-
    A guided deep meditation in savasana with props for comfort, offering
    relaxation and mindfulness equivalent to hours of sleep.
  class_description: >
    All levels and abilities are welcome! This practice is performed in a
    resting pose (savasana) with no other movements or asanas (positions)
    involved. You will be guided through a deep meditation (including guided
    imagery) to facilitate a deep state of consciousness. Props (bolsters, yoga
    blankets, blocks) are utilized to provide a level of comfort as you allow
    yourself time for effortless relaxation that promotes the systematic
    unwinding of the unconscious mind.


    Yoga Nidra is often referred to as “yogic sleep”. It is an intentional time
    of deep meditation practice that provides you body and mind an experience of
    peace and mindfulness equivalent to 2-4 hours of restful sleep. Yoga Nidra
    can help calm the sympathetic nervous system. The benefits of a healthy
    sympathetic nervous system can be seen in managing stress/anxiety, heart
    rate, sleep patterns, and more.
