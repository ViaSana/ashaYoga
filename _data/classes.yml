  class_description: >-
    Mysore-style Ashtanga offers a unique, self-paced approach to yoga practice,
    blending personalized instruction with the energy of a group setting. You'll
    move through a specific sequence of postures at your own rhythm, with your
    teacher providing one-on-one guidance, adjustments, and support as needed.

    New students receive plenty of focused attention to help build a strong
    foundation, while more experienced practitioners are encouraged to deepen
    and refine their practice. You are welcome to arrive any time between 6:00
    and 8:00 AM to ensure you complete your practice by 9:00 AM.

    This class is open to all levels — from absolute beginners to seasoned
    yogis. We can even incorporate the use of chairs, blocks, and other items to
    meet you where you are.

    Commit to your journey. Meet yourself on the mat.

    Chair Yoga is a gentle form of yoga that uses a chair for support in both
    seated and standing postures. Perfect for beginners, older adults, those
    recovering from injury, or anyone looking for a slower-paced practice. This
    class offers the benefits of yoga—improved flexibility, circulation,
    balance, and mental clarity—without the need to get down on the floor.


    You’ll explore breathwork, gentle movement, and mindfulness, all while
    supported by the stability of a chair. Come as you are—no experience
    necessary.

    at your own pace, and leave feeling empowered, refreshed, and more at home
    within yourself.

    All bodies, all backgrounds, all experiences welcome. (If you have mobility

  class_description: >-
    Start your week with intention, calm, and connection. This rejuvenating
    class begins with mindful, flowing movements and breathwork to awaken the
    body and center the mind. We then transition into supported, foundational
    postures, using props like bolsters, blocks, and blankets to invite deeper
    relaxation. Each pose is held for 3–5 minutes, allowing time to release
    tension and cultivate stillness.

    We close with a peaceful meditation and an extended savasana, leaving you
    grounded, refreshed, and ready for the week ahead.

    All levels are welcome. Participants should be comfortable moving between
    the floor and standing.
