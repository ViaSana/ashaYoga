    instruction and pacing while following a specific set of movements. 
  class_description: >-
    Mysore-style Ashtanga offers a unique, self-paced approach to yoga practice,
    blending personalized instruction with the energy of a group setting. You'll
    move through a specific sequence of postures at your own rhythm, with your
    teacher providing one-on-one guidance, adjustments, and support as needed.

    New students receive plenty of focused attention to help build a strong
    foundation, while more experienced practitioners are encouraged to deepen
    and refine their practice. You are welcome to arrive any time between 6:00
    and 8:00 AM to ensure you complete your practice by 9:00 AM.

    This class is open to all levels — from absolute beginners to seasoned
    yogis. We can even incorporate the use of chairs, blocks, and other items to
    meet you where you are.

    Commit to your journey. Meet yourself on the mat.

    Our Flow classes are designed to meet you exactly where you are. Whether
    you're stepping onto the mat for the first time or deepening an ongoing
    practice, you'll find an energizing and supportive space here. Each class
    blends mindful movement, breath, and strength-building sequences to help you
    reconnect with your body and spirit.

    We believe yoga is a personal journey — not about perfect poses, but about
    showing up for yourself with dedication and curiosity. Come as you are, move
    at your own pace, and leave feeling empowered, refreshed, and more at home
    within yourself.

    All bodies, all backgrounds, all experiences welcome. (If you have mobility
    issues, please discuss with staff and we will likely be able to accommodate
    you!)
